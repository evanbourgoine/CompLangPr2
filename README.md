The Scheme program created uses the samples list, symbol table, and post-processing function 
by categorizing the input and performing the updates needed. My overall approach to this project 
was to work from the project instructions, such as starting with the basic instructions until it 
worked correctly from the input/output files given, and then move to the post-processing section, 
and finally the editing requirement. When I would run into issues with the output not being what 
was expected, I would primary add more printf statements at different areas of the code to check 
if the data was being stored, and processed correctly.
